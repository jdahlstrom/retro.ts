# retro.ts

A journey into retro graphics programming in [TypeScript][ts].

This project aims to demonstrate how to write a working 3D rasterizer just by putting pixels on the screen one at a time, the way game and [demoscene][demo] programmers did it _circa_ 1995, before the era of consumer GPUs. It is also an experiment in combining a [literate programming][litprog] style with version control, with each chapter its own commit modifying a single "living" codebase.

## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of JavaScript and the browser environment.
* Some understanding of geometry, trigonometry, and (linear) algebra.
* Previous TypeScript knowledge may be helpful but is _not_ required.
